Aspiring Cloud Engineer

I focus on building reliable systems and improving deployment workflows. I learn through hands-on projects and small experiments that show clear results.

What I work on

• Deploying apps on AWS EC2 and Lightsail

• Setting up CI/CD with GitHub Actions

• Writing clean Docker setups for small services

• Managing servers with Linux basics

• Monitoring services with simple

dashboards

• Testing cloud tools through real projects

Skills

• AWS EC2, S3, IAM

• Docker

• Nginx

• Git and GitHub

• Linux server setup

• Basic Terraform


Goals

• Build stronger automation skills

• Gain more real cloud experience through projects


You can follow my progress here as I build more cloud focused work and refine my engineering process.
